== Icebot ==

Did you hear about the Icebot on Justin.tv? The one which was able to do some
entertainment here and there? Which was hosted by Icedream? Yes? You will be
surprised how much I've changed this bot now, but as soon as I find the right
words to put these changes here, you will be really surprised...

=== Getting the code ===

You can read the url to clone from on https://github.com/icedream/Icebot.
After you cloned the code, run ./download-external.sh or download-external.bat
depending on your system to get the rest of the components still needed by
Icebot. I will soon do that myself from scratch. ;)
